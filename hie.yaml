# TODO remove this once HLS properly supports cabal scripts:
  # https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/111
# until then, we must install the libs from build-depends, e.g:
  # cabal install --lib dhall extra language-javascript shake shake-dhall text --package-env=.'
    # and, in VScode at least, copy the env file up to the root of the project folder
      # perhaps HLS should set $PWD differently
    # this wouldn't be necessary if 'cabal run --write-ghc-environment-files=always' actually wrote the files
